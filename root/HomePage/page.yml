    Hello, welcome to PimpTest - get ready to Pimp Your Tests!!!
     PimpTest is meant to be an improvement over the FitNesse wiki.
     Think of FitNesse, but with a web 2.0 interface as well as a repository
     for fixtures that are reused frequently.  There isn't as much in the way of
     free-form editing, but you can add text, headings, and tables to a test page.
     If that isn't enough, it is fully extendable so you can add any type of UI widget
     that you would like to be able to insert on a page.  Prepare to make it rain, 
     dollar-dollar bill y'all.  word.
