  :content: "h3. EDI Send Table Info\n\n\
    This table will eventually send some EDI data.  First, I have to wire the fixtures up to some sort of test runner.  Should I roll my own, or try to find one somewhere else.\n\n\
    Also,  need to devise a plan for incorporating FitNesse fixtures (Ruby and Java) into this thing.  Maybe I should take a look at rubyfit?\n    "

    This is some text that will go on the page.  It will be
     stuck inside a paragraph tag.  All newlines will be replaced
     with &lt;br&gt; tags.
