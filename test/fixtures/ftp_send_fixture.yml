    This method sends EDI data from the sender to the receiver
    
    The message class and table name are passed in normally, but will
    
    be added to the siteparams if needed.  Any other site params that
    
    need to be applied to the session should be put into the siteparms field in the
    
    style of: parm=>val;parm=>val.  Also,
    
    if keepalive is true, it will keep the FTP session alive across method calls
