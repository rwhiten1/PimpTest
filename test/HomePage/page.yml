    "Hello, welcome to PimpTest - get ready to Pimp Your Tests!!!\n
    PimpTest is meant to be an improvement over the FitNesse wiki.\n
    Think of FitNesse, but with a web 2.0 interface as well as a repository\n
    for fixtures that are reused frequently.  There isn't as much in the way of\n
    free-form editing, but you can add text, headings, and tables to a test page.\n
    If that isn't enough, it is fully extendable so you can add any type of UI widget\n
    that you would like to be able to insert on a page.  Prepare to make it rain, \n
    dollar-dollar bill y'all.  word."
